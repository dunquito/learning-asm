It has come to my attention that you never truly know how software works until you have some grasp on assembly. In my short career as a security professional, I've already come to find that understanding assembly is essential to understanding the behavior of software. 

This repo will showcase my attempt to learn more about it.

A short disclaimer: this repository is for educational purposes only and is does not attempt to showcase "production-level" code, best practices, or even safe practices. In other words, this repo will contain vast nonsense.
